###### This repository is mine. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

This exists simply to create a ~/.var directory. This gets used for things
like storing runtime data for processes such as consul and vault. I wanted
to make sure I had a user-owned location to target, and the only way that
I could guarantee that in-repo was to target something in ${HOME}. :P
